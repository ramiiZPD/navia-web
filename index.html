                <p>Above mentioned research gap gives the idea about the gap between the existing features that
                    have provided by the existing systems. It clearly shows the benefits that users can get by using
                    the approach that we are going to introduced. Followings are the brief descriptions about the
                    research problems that we are going to introduce after completing our approach.
                    Concept of having huge malls is quite new for Sri lankan. Even though we can see a rapid
                    growth of having huge malls. Navigating through these malls without getting lost has become a
                    considerable matter. Living in a era where everyone is having a busy life, having navigation
                    through these malls is a necessity in order to save time. This era is famous for less social
                    interactions but more interactions with the mobile devices and internet. In order to come up with
                    a problem that is getting lost in a huge malls, can be output as the user’s favourable.</p>
                  <h4>Research Gap</h4>
                  <p>In Sri Lankans having a huge mall is a new Concept even though we can see a rapid growth
                    of having huge malls. In an era where time is a very important and limited finding a place in a
                    huge mall is a bit of a messy task to do if it is the first time at the mall. Been able to

                    out on the new upcoming solutions for problems like these we came across applications that
                    give a 3D view for a particular indoor environment, so that users can refer those and navigate
                    through the mall. Creating an indoor environment one by one is time consuming and an expensive task since
                    models must be created and must also input details on each and every location so to navigate
                    through. It could be concluded that the feature that is not yet available in the new indoor
                    navigation applications is to self-generate GIS environment for any given sample floor plan.

                    growth of having huge malls. Navigating through these malls without getting lost has become 
                    a considerable matter. Living in a era where everyone is having a busy life, having navigation
                    through these malls is a necessity in order to save time. Existing solution applications are
                    giving 3D view for indoor, so that users can refer those and navigate through the mall, but the
                    researchers prove that users tend to like actual view more. Huge the malls get more the users become confused about where they are and to where they
                    should go. That’s the place where indoor positioning comes. Wifi fingerprinting and
                    bluetooth beacons have used as the base of many existing indoor positioning systems.
                    Problem they encounter was the range of Wifi and bluetooth. Calculations shows that the wifi
                    has 32 meters range. Which is not enough to determine the location. The other main problem is to find the way to a specific place in a huge mall without getting
                    lost. System should be able to display the shortest and the most preferable path to the user.
                    Path that user selects can change according to the users’ preferences and it’s better if the the
                    user has multiple options in this case. One of the existing ways of getting the shortest is to
                    convert the images into a graph. But the drawback of that is it is time consuming. User might
                    not want to spend some considerable amount of time till the application converts the images
                    into a graph and then calculate the shortest path from that. Over the past years users had a hard time locating themselves to their intended
                    destination.When it comes to huge shopping malls user gets confused about where they are
                    and where they should go.It is a complicated task to find a shop inside a huge high complex
                    shopping mall even with a pre knowledge of the buidling.How often have you had a hard
                    time locating ourselves to the correct shop we were supposed to be in?How convenient
                    would it be to have a hand held indoor navigation application that can be used to guide the
                    user to their desired destination. For long as we can remember positioning it has been important to know where we are in the
                    world in the olden days we used compass and maps to find our way around. Nowadays we
                    use GPS to find our way when traveling by vehicles or foot.GPS is incredibly useful
                    technology most of us rely on GPS in some form however there is big problem the GPS navigation doesn’t work inside an indoor environment.GPS signals can be reflected by walls
                    making it less accurate and in cities.On an average day here in Sri Lanka we might walk
                    miles to find our desired destination basically tracking own position of the customer and
                    navigate to his/her intended destination in big complex building like shopping malls highly
                    challenging task most of the shopping malls have several shops they can’t be easily
                    monitored manually and finding a specific place inside a building especially when it’s the
                    first time in that building is time consuming and higher probability of getting lost but using
                    this application,user should be able to find the shortest path and the most popular path to
                    user’s intended destination and user can locate themselves to the desired destination.In fact,It
                    reduces time wastage because customers don't have to move around to find out a specific
                    location instead,they channel that time into doing other important tasks. Many alternative solutions have been presented over the past years most of the technologies
                    based on distance measurement to nearby wifi access points, magnetic field positioning and
                    RSS.When it comes to fingerprinting method signal strength is collected from known
                    locations and then store it in a database.When identifying the location the users current
                    location coordinates are querying from the database if the users unknown coordinates is
                    compared with the stored prior measured data so every time user need to identify his/her
                    location user needs to query the unknown location coordinates and compare against to the
                    stored data and most challenging task is the maintenance of the database and the storing the
                    measured huge amount of data in the database and its time consuming.
                    Above mentioned research gap gives the idea about the gap between the existing features that
                    have provided by the existing systems. It clearly shows the benefits that users can get by
                    using the approach that we are going to introduced. Followings are the brief descriptions

                    Concept of having huge malls is quite new for Sri lankan. Even though we can see a rapid
                    growth of having huge malls. Navigating through these malls without getting lost has become
                    a considerable matter. Living in a era where everyone is having a busy life, having navigation
                    through these malls is a necessity in order to save time. This era is famous for less social
                    interactions but more interactions with the mobile devices and internet. In order to come up
                    with a problem that is getting lost in a huge malls, can be output as the user’s favourable. One of the main problems is to find the way to a specific place in a huge mall without getting
                    lost. System should be able to display the shortest and the most preferable path to the user.
                    Path that user selects can change according to the users’ preferences and it’s better if the the
                    user has multiple options in this case. One of the existing ways of getting the shortest is to
                    convert the images into a graph. But the drawback of that is it is time consuming. User might
                    not want to spend some considerable amount of time till the application converts the images
                    into a graph and then calculate the shortest path from that. Getting the shortest path or the user preferable path has becoming more and more
                    challengeable. Mostly because each and every commonly used or the existing algorithms
                    consumes higher pre processing power and the memory. Mostly this higher pre processing
                    power is required to generate the visibility graph. Some given solutions are proposing to
                    minimize the size of the visibility graph so that the pre processing power can be saved. But
                    the getting optimal path within a short time is the real challenge. As we can clearly see in the literature review, genetic algorithms can be used to get the
                    shortest path. By developing a dynamic fitness function to each user optimal paths can be
                    retrieved. Issue that occurs with the genetic algorithm is the accuracy. Since there are more
                    local minimum and one global minimum drawback is the cannot be hundred percent assure
                    that the algorithms reaches to the global minimum. There can be a scenarios where it reaches
                    the local minimum and assuming it as the global minimum and stop the function running.
                    Other challenge is since the GPS is not working fine in the environment, get the paths
                    between given two nodes. Most of the approaches tries to convert the map into a graph but all
                    those methods takes much time. Since this solution is going to be an android mobile
                    application, I can't be expecting system to take much more pre processing time. Then the
                    application will be slow and it will eventually caused to the user dissatisfaction. Giving the
                    optimal path should be the ultimate goal but when achieving that goal, user satisfaction
                  should be a key factor to consider.</p>
                  <h4>Objectives</h4>
                  <p>Our main intention in this study is to, come up with a solution which has better indoor
                      localization and visual based indoor navigation with intelligent path finder. The research
                      team is willing to accomplish those objectives by developing a web application and a mobile application.</p>
                  <h4>Methodology</h4>
                  <p>The system that is proposed in our research consist of 2 application. A web application and a
                      mobile application. The web application is mostly handled by the system admin or owner of a
                      particular building to upload the floor plans of the building and configure the building as
                      required. Also the web application allows a 360 tour on the indoor environment for users
                      trying to navigate through the web application. The web application is connected directly
                      with the server and database with Restful APIs. The mobile application is built using android. This is targeted only for the users since it
                      allows the users to navigate through the indoor environment using the shortest, most
                      preferable and popular path. Also helps in in tracking the location of user in an indoor
                      environment.</p>

              <h4>GIS map generation - Litreture Review</h4>
              <p>In the research done by Hande Hong, Kartik Sankaran from School Of Computing, National
                  University of Singapore and Chengwen Luo and Jianqiang Li from collage of computer science
                  and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, China they had found a way to generate
                  an indoor map using walking trajectories captured through inertial sensing and crowdsourcing
                  where they merge all the paths to generate the indoor map. Also higher-level schematic objects
                  such as doors, stairs, elevators etc. can be detected in this method of process. In their system
                  they collect all the relevant data using mobile device and the server program collects all the
                  crowdsourced trajectories and performs map inference and semantic-based localization queries
                  to generate a map. However in this method of gathering information and configuring the floor
                  plan, there have been some problems due to conflicts in repeating pathways. In a research by
                  SungTae Moon, Wesub Eom from the Aerospace Convergence Technology Team, Korea
                  Aerospace Research Institute proposed a design for large scale map generation which uses
                  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technologies that generates a 2D image of
                  the map and later converts it into a 3D. Using Sensors such as LiDAR (Light Detection and
                  Ranging), SONAR (Sound Navigation And Ranging) and RGB-D camera a 2D image can be
                  generated with the help of Hector Simultaneous Localization and Mapping technology. This
                  method of indoor mapping generated an accurate floor plan by using sensors. This method has
                  proven useful however working with such devices is not economically beneficial for users or
                  partners using that technology. In a research done by Xuan Du and Dongdai Zhou they found
                  a way to generate a path from a Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) which contains the polygons
                  representing rooms’ outline, coordinates of rooms’ door and polylines indicating the corridors.
                  Based on the data and the pathway mapping that was available they were able to identify a
                  pathway graph for the indoor environment. However they were able to identify a pathway
                  for each and every node only if the details were mentioned on the map graphically. Thus this
                  method is only applicable for static indoor environments.</p>
              <h4>360 Navigation - Litreture Review</h4>
              <p>With the research references we did, we discovered there are few solutions for the individual
                  components of our study. Over the years there were some number of researches has presented
                  regarding those components, but there were some considerable number of issues in
                  performance and the complexity of them are also bit high. From the research referencing
                  which is done by our research team, we haven’t met any research which has all the
                  components of our study. In the research done by R. Abhilash and P.Asha from Department
                  of Computer Science, Sathyabama University they have discussed about an indoor
                  navigation solution which is limited to a single area. In their proposed solution, both 2D and
                  3D maps will be displayed and by entering the source and the destination they will display
                  the paths that they can use. Since they are not using Global positioning system (GPS) or any
                  similar kind of technology user cannot find the path to the destination from his/her exact
                  location. If we need to user this system in another place, we need to create a 3D model of that
                  place as well. From a study our research team have done, we found that many users like to
                  interact with the actual view than a 3D view. Athira Sudarsanan V, Michael George, Babita
                  Roslind Jose and Jimson Mathew of Cochin University of Science And Technology, Kochi
                  and Indian Institute of Technology Patna have discussed about the indoor navigation
                  problem in a different perspective. Their approach was to generate a topological map and
                  images from the different locations of the building using a walkthrough video. From this
                  video, the system will extract the important frames (keyframes) and construct the topological
                  map. We can apply this approach to anywhere and to take this approach first we need to have a
                  walkthrough video of the whole building. In our approach first we need to capture 3600
                  images from a mobile phone or any other device in appropriate distance, and then apply them
                  on top of the map. In the research done by Low Chee Huey, Patrick Sebastian and Micheal
                  Drieberg of electrical and electronic engineering department, universiti Teknologi Petronas
                   proposed and designed an augmented reality based indoor positioning navigation tool to
                  superimpose the directional signage on the real view of the indoor environment in 3D form.
                  The team have used ARtoolkit software to do the implementation and using ARtoolkit,
                  application will display a 3D marker in the camera view, to guide the user to the destination.
                  Since they are using a mobile application, users have to use their laptop webcam. </p>
              <h4>Shortest path/preferable path generation - Litreture Review</h4>
              <p>
                  In the research done by R. Abhilash and P.Asha from Department of Computer Science,
                  Sathyabama University they have discussed about an indoor navigation solution which is
                  limited to a single area. In their proposed solution, both 2D and 3D maps will be displayed and
                  by entering the source and the destination they will display the paths that they can use. Since user
                  won’t be given shortest path user has to pick a random path and navigate through it which may
                  results to user navigates through the longest path and which will consume time. In ICET
                  conference at Ohrid, Macedonia have discussed about a solution for finding a shortest path
                  in a Maze. To get that approach they have used a robot to navigate from a one position to the exit
                  of the maze and then implemented an algorithm for movements of the robot. Their main
                  consideration was to get images of the maze from the top and convert it into a graph. These
                  images indicate walls, empty spaces and the starting positions and end destination of the robot.
                  Then they convert the maze into bitset from a graph which indicate the valid positions of the
                  robot as vertices. Furthermore they have mentioned that after generating the graph, algorithm that are to find the
                  shortest path can be applied on top of that. They have introduced an algorithm which has
                  implemented the breadth first search. This algorithm will outcome the shortest path by observing
                  the starting and ending vertices and the least passed vertices. After this research they have identified that converting the image into the graph can be time
                  consuming when the dimensions are higher numbers. And the time that consumed to find the
                  shortest path varies according to the dimensions of the maze. In a research which was done by Department of Geography and Geoinformation Science, GMU
                  . Their main approach was to collect crowdsources geospatial data and obtain the path that
                  minimizing the distance and the paths which lead through the popular areas by using knowledge
                  granted by users. The way of their implementation is was extracting words like “nearby” or “next
                  to” from travel blogs which are basically defining the closeness between two places. These text
                  processing part was done by using Python, modeling and implementing part has done by usingMatlab. And by using a probabilistic model, quantifying each of these relations. Using this they
                  create a relationship graph where each node of the graph correspond to s POI(Points of interest)
                  and the each edges of the graph defining the spatial connection between those respective points.
                  Then they obtained a altered cost function which is not relay on the distance. Finally they have
                  proposed a two routing algorithms which enrich the road network. They have used Flicker photo
                  data to test these algorithm to real datasets. This research was done by Daniel Delling, Andrew V. Goldberg, Moises Goldszmidt, John
                  Krumm, Kunal Talwar, Renato F. Werneck from Microsoft Research. Their main approach
                  was to implement and a test a framework which is generating personalized driving directions.
                  These directions are given by analysing user’s GPS tracks automatically. In order to fulfill this
                  approach they model the road network as a directed graph G = (V,A) . This framework based on
                  customizable route planning (CRP) in order to find the shortest path. Then finally they have
                  come up with an algorithm which contains three parametres. This approach works fine for
                  outdoors where GPS works finely. In a research which was done by Anders Strand-Holm
                  Vinther (20033980 ) and Magnus Strand-Holm Vinther (20094430 ) in AarhusUniversity-
                  Computer Science discuss about pathfinding in two dimensional world. In the research they
                  have introduced their own optimal path finding algorithm called Binary Space Partitioning
                  (BSP). Their main focus was to come up with a better optimizing algorithm. All the other optimizing algorithms relay on a heavy pre processing steps on creating a visibility graph. So
                  their approach was to decrease the size of the visibility graph. This research works fine for
                  dynamic polygonal worlds. And when comes to the other algorithms like Dijikstra and A*, the
                  algorithm they came up with this research has lower preprocessing time. In research done by Geethu Elizebeth Mathew in K.S.R Institute for Engineering and
                  Technology - Tiruchengode Namakka introduced a direction based Heuristic for pathfinding
                  in video games. Their intention is to come up with a solution to get higher quality paths using
                  less memory and time than the other algorithms do. In order to achieve their approach they are
                  proposing to use Artificial intelligence principles. Instead of having a graph as all the other
                  existing algorithms do, this approach is implements so that the map will be converted to a grid as
                  below. Direction based heuristic that is introduced in this research, will minimize the nodes in the map
                  but still give the optimal path in less time. In research done by Ahmed Younes Hamed in
                  Department of COmputer science, faculty of science Sohag university Egypt is introducing a
                  genetic algorithm for finding k shortest paths in a network. Their solution works fine for single
                  source node and multiple destination. During the Literature review I have identified many attempts to overcome the generating optimal
                  paths. From the Literature review written in this document you can get a very clear understanding
                  about the current proposed solutions and the drawbacks of those solutions following is a brief
                  description about the research gap and main drawbacks in the existing solutions compared to my
                  proposed research solution. The complexity was caused due to the signal strength of Bluetooth/Wifi such as the bluetooth
                  signal range limited to 10 meters. The accuracy of the Bluetooth iBeacons is high compared to
                  Wifi. But it need expensive infrastructure assistant since we have to deploy Bluetooth iBeacons in
                  known places in a building and the narrow transmission range which limited to 30-200m is the
                  main drawback in Wifi indoor navigation systems however compared to BLE transmitters Wi-Fi needs more expensive installation.
                  Other than the hardware approaches, other approaches that are available were the algorithms. As
                  you can see in the literature review most of the researchers are trying to come up with algorithms
                  to get a optimal paths which consumes less pre processing power and the less memory than the
                  existing algorithms. Most commonly used and most advanced existing algorithm to get the
                  optimal path is the A* Algorithm. This algorithm is mostly and commonly used for path finding.
                  It is considered to be one of the smartest algorithms which makes the different between other
                  conventional algorithms. Drawback of this algorithm is A* algorithm requires higher pre processing power in order to
                  generate visibility graph. Most of the researchers are trying to minimize the time that is taken to
                  generate the visibility graph and the memory that A* algorithm requires. Genetic ALgorithms can be used to get the optimal paths by using the fitness function the issue
                  is with the accuracy level. Since genetic algorithms are not a hundred percent assure about
                  reaching the global minimum since there are many local minimums. Some solutions that are mentioned in the literature review, works fine for the outdoor scenarios
                  where GPS is working fine. SInce this solution is for the indoor environment that cannot be used.

              <h4>Indoor positioning - Litreture Review</h4>
              <p>During the past years there have been lot of research projects proposed to develop an accurate
                  solution for the indoor positioning and most of the indoor positioning systems developed with
                  the help of Bluetooth beacons, tedious adjustments, high expensive sensors and costly
                  infrastructure. In the research done by Christian Esposito and Massimo Ficco from University
                  of Nepol They have proposed about an indoor positioning system based on RSS. In their
                  approach when positioning inside an indoor environment, user’s location is identified by
                  comparing user location's signal strength value and the prior measured signal strength values
                  of known locations. The user’s location is identified if the stored pre-measured signal
                  strength value and the new value is tally with each other. If the user’s current location signal
                  strength value and the pre-stored value not equal to each other it will be a big issue. And the
                  RMI devices should be deployed to measure the signal strength values.
                  Over the decades most of the indoor positioning systems are based on Wifi fingerprinting.
                  In the research done by Pei Jiang, Yunzhou Zhang, Wenyan Fu, Huiyu Liu and Xiaolin Su
                  from Department of Weaponry Engineering, Naval University of Engineering College of
                  Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University they have proposed a
                  solution for indoor positioning based on Wi-Fi fingerprinting. This proposed approach
                  requires time consuming manual correction of data.According to the analysis done by
                  Shixiong Xia, Yi Liu, Guan Yuan, Mingjun Zhu and Zhaohui Wang School of Computer
                  Science Technology, China University of Mining and Technology China
                  they mentioned the disadvantages of Wi-Fi fingerprinting indoor positioning approach.
                  The Wi-Fi fingerprinting technique needs advanced algorithms and this approach need an
                  outsized quantity of pre-measured information for identification of the position of the user. iBeacon is another proposed technique to detect the user’s indoor position but there are some
                  drawbacks in iBeacons due to the Bluetooth signal strength because the Bluetooth signal
                  range is narrow it limits to maximum 10m.This may be affected to the calculation of the
                  distance because distance is calculated based on the transmission of the Bluetooth signal. The
                  company named Estimote Inc provide a Complete Software Development Kit (SDK). There
                  are some problems in Estimote iBeacons.It’s only supports for IOS and provide equipment
                  and SDK, not the application services. And the indoor map is not much user friendly and only
                  display 2D information of the indoor environment in our approach we are going to display
                  both 2D and 3D view. From the study our research team has done, we found most effective indoor positioning
                  technique is using a smartphone main benefit of using a smart for indoor positioning is,
                  system is not depending on infrastructure. In this research we are going to use accelerometer
                  and gyroscope inertial sensors to overcome this indoor positioning technique by using those
                  sensors we can get readings of Orientation, Compass, Gravity and Linear Movement.
                  In the research done by Supriya, S. Aruna Devi and Karthick Nanmaran of Department of
                  Computer Science and Engineering, SRM University, Chennai, India they have proposed a
                  technique to get the user’s current location by tapping the floor map displayed in the android
                  application but if the user doesn’t have any prior knowledge of the interior information of the
                  building it is difficult to tap the floor map to get the current position, to overcome this
                  problem we have proposed a solution Codes will be pasted on the walls of the building at
                  certain points. The user can scan the QR code and get the input of the current/starting
                  position of him inside the building. Then it can be shown in the map using the android map.
                  By comparing the current situation and the place where the user has to go the routes can be
                  shown including the shortest path. The indoor positioning is a main function of an indoor navigation system accuracy of the
                  indoor positioning component mainly affect to the accuracy of the entire indoor navigation
                  system. Indoor positioning can be divided into four different parts based on the methodology.
                  Triangulation based, direct sensing, pattern recognition and dead reckoning.
                  Triangulation methodology and direct-sensing needs infrastructure assistance. The Bluetooth
                  based indoor positioning systems and WIFI signal based indoor positioning systems needs
                  expertise to fix the Bluetooth beacons or Wi-Fi routers in known positions inside an indoor In research done by Carl Fischer, Kavitha Muthukrishnan, Mike Hazas and Hans Gellersen of
                  Department of computing of Lancaster University Lancaster, UK.and University of Twente
                  Enschede, The Netherlands they have proposed a navigation system based on a combination
                  of foot-mounted inertial sensors and ultrasound beacons. They have used landmarks when the
                  user enters into an unknown environment. In their they have used ultrasound nodes from
                  the Relate project as landmarks to correct the drift in PDR. Some other projects have used
                  Ultrasound in order to predict the indoor position. The landmarks are quite interesting
                  when there are multiple users and locate themselves to a destination relative to each other.
                  In research done by Agustinus Noertjahyana, Ignatius Alex Wijayanto, Justinus
                  Andjarwirawan Department of Informatics Petra Christian University Surabaya, Indonesia
                  they have proposed a solution for indoor positioning using android and bluetooth low energy
                  with trilateration method They have used sensor beacon bluetooth low energy with the
                  advantages of having low power consumption and relatively small dimensions that can be
                  placed in various places that are difficult to reach by WiFi.Trilateration is a method for
                  determining location with known three location information and device distance to each
                  access point. They have used Trilateration method with measurement technique based on
                  RSSI value. The main consequence of this solution is Bluetooth Low Energy focuses on
                  short-range communications. If the transmission power is high the range of the
                  transmitted signal is high, so it increases the usage of the battery. In the research done by Andreas Blattner, Yavor Vasilev and Bettina Harriehausen-
                  Mühlbauer they have proposed a Mobile indoor navigation assistance system for mobility
                  impaired people. They have developed Mobile application which identify barrier-free routes
                  between starting position and the intended destination. This feature is more useful for
                  impaired people. They have used Bluetooth 4.0 transmitters which send UUIDs to predict the
                  starting position. User’s current position is identified by trilateration of the signal strength of
                  each transmitter. The new UUID design is useful for providing the information needed to
                  determine the location of the device by the Trilateration method. The intended
                  destination is manually chosen by the user according to the user’s preferences it will
                  displayed as a geo location. Crowded environments like shopping malls can harm the
                  accuracy of the application so the accuracy of the application depend on the environment because human bodies interfere with the Bluetooth signal. so mainly accuracy of the
                  location determination depends on the environment of the reference point
                  In the research done by Laura Filardo, Federica Inderst, Federica Pascucci they have
                  developed an Android app which based on a background service. This background service
                  able to log data retrieved from the 9-Degree of Freedom IMU embedded in a smartphone and
                  to compute the current user position. This application able to detect the position of the user
                  inside an indoor environment using inbuilt sensors of the smart phone. The position of the
                  user is displayed on a map. The main objective of this system is to continuously track user’s
                  position during motion when starting position is given. The main disadvantage of these smart
                  phone based indoor positioning system is the accuracy of the application depends on the
                  orientation of the sensor frame with respect to the body frame. In their solution user wears a
                  smartphone so the body frame corresponds to the sensor frame. When we consider a
                  practical scenario user never wear a smart phone while walking so their solution is not much
                  realistic. According to the research done by David Mascharka and Eric Manley Department of
                  Mathematics and Computer Science Drake University they have proposed a solution for
                  indoor positioning using mobile device based on readings from its sensors utilizing machine
                  learning methodologies. The positioning component is separated into two different parts data
                  collection and analysis. The data collection phase consists of moving about the building
                  taking readings of the Wi-Fi signal strengths so before using the application lot of pre-
                  measured data should be gathered. In the analysis phase several machine learning algorithms
                  are used. Some preprocessing of the data may be beneficial, depending on the algorithm. In
                  the final stage they have tested the application while walking inside an indoor environment.
                  In the research done by Eladio Martin, Oriol Vinyals , Gerald Friedland , Ruzena Bajcsy
                  International Computer Science Institute and Dept. of EECS University of California,
                  Berkeley they have proposed a solution for Indoor Localization Using Smart Phones. In order
                  to build a multimodal solution, they have studied the technologies related to Wi-Fi radio,
                  cellular communication radio and the inbuilt android sensors accelerometer and
                  magnetometer. They have obtained a radio map(Fingerprinting approach) of Wifi RSSI
                  values moving around the building and the position of the user is identified by comparing the current value and the stored RSSI values.[19]There are several attempts to track the indoor
                  positioning without fingerprinting but those solutions show an important loss in accuracy.
                  Fingerprinting approach is basically creating a map of SS vectors. Each vector belongs to the
                  coordinate of the measurement taken in the area of interest.
                  According to the research done by Thibaut Raharijaona, Rodolphe Mawonou , Thanh Vu
                  Nguyen , Fabien Colonnier , Marc Boyron , Julien Diperi and Stéphane Viollet they have a
                  proposed a solution for indoor positioning using Flickering Infrared LEDs.They have used ,
                  minimalistic optical sensing device is used in order to detect relative position between the
                  sensor and active markers. The relative position is identified using amplitude modulated
                  infrared light. The innovative insect-based sensor can measure azimuth and elevation angles
                  with respect to two small and cheap active infrared light emitting diodes (LEDs) flickering at
                  two different frequencies by comparing previous lens less visual sensor the position of the
                  user is identified. There are various indoor positioning solutions using infrared beacons
                  but there are several disadvantages of infrared when we use it to detect the indoor
                  position. Infrared is only suitable for short-distance transmission and the positioning accuracy
                  has limitations. A major disadvantage of infrared based systems is that they require
                  substantial infrastructure changes and incur a significant cost to deploy.
                  The authors in have developed a mechanism for indoor position system using
                  Magnetic signature. First, they have fingerprinted each hallway using measured magnetic
                  signature. They have obtained the user’s position in meters by classifying the test signature
                  when user enters to an unknown hallway and the one of the measured fingerprints. The
                  fingerprints were collected in different hallways. Magnetic field anomalies also used for
                  pinpoint user’s position inside a building. Some other authors have created a magnetic
                  map using artificial magnetic beacons. The major problem in those solutions is the
                  preliminary scene preparation for the future positioning. In the research done by by Supriya, S. Aruna Devi and Karthick Nanmaran of Department of
                  Computer Science and Engineering, SRM University, Chennai, India they have proposed
                  a technique to get the traveled distance by assuming the two steps taken by the user
                  approximately equal to 1 meter and they have divided the floor map into grids of side 1
                  meter. Despite of the lower accuracy achievable by using the approximation, we proposed to
                  apply our approach to get the most accurate Distance.</p>
